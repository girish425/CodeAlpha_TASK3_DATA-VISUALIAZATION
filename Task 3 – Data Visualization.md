#### **Task 3 – Data Visualization**

**-------------------------------------------------**





##### **Objective**

**----------------**

* To transform raw data into meaningful visual insights using charts and graphs.
* I have cleaned up the raw data into meaningful data .
* I have used python libraries like pandas, seaborn and matplotlib.pyplot for my analysis and for creating plots and visuals to extract meaningful insights from the plots
* I have created 5-6 charts(eg=bar graph,pie chart,histrogram,scatter plot)
* I have mentioned insights and conclusions for each chart separately in the below





##### **Tools used**

**----------------**

*  **Python**
*  **Pandas**
*  **Matplotlib**
*  **Seaborn**







##### **Conclusions**

**------------------**



**CHART-1:SUBSCRIPTION PLAN DISTRIBUTION**

**------------------------------------------**



* Chart used: Bar graph



* Why Bar graph: I have used Bar graph because it is used to represent categorical data(subscription plans),Exact values and relative heights are clearly visible at a glance, which suits summary insights



* Insights from the graph:

1. Standard plan is the most popular, with around 2000 users,
2. indicating it offers the best balance of price and features,
3.  Basic and Premium plans have similar user counts (~1500 each), suggesting neither strongly dominates the other,
4. the graph indicates the most of users favour a balanced plan offered with moderate cost and have enough features



* conclusion: The subscription data shows that the Standard plan is the most preferred among users, while the Basic and Premium plans attract a similar but smaller number of users.







**CHART-2 :Satisfaction Score vs Annual Income**

**---------------------------------------------**



* Chart used: Scatter plot



* Why scatter plot: I have used  scatter plot because it helps us to study the relationship between two numerical variables, it helps us see patterns, clusters too.



* Insights from the plot:

1. we can see that the points are scattered all along the graph which specifies that there is no liner relationship between 2 variables.
2. The data looks randomly distributed, meaning income alone doesn’t explain satisfaction



* conclusion:The scatter plot shows no clear relationship between satisfaction score and annual income. Satisfaction appears independent of income level





**CHART-3 :Average satisfaction score vs subscription  plan**

**----------------------------------------------------------**



* Chart used: Bar graph



* Why bar graph:I have used Bar graph because it is used to represent categorical data(subscription plans),Exact values and relative heights are clearly visible at a glance, which suits summary insights



* Insights from the graph:

1. The average satisfaction scores for Basic, Standard, and Premium plans are very close to each other.
2. No subscription plan clearly outperforms the others in terms of customer satisfaction.
3. This suggests users across all plans have a similar experience.



* conclusion:Overall, customer satisfaction is consistent across all subscription plans, indicating that plan type does not significantly affect satisfaction levels.





**CHART-4 :Histogram of age**

**--------------------------**



* Chart used:Histogram



* Why histogram:

1. A histogram is used to understand the distribution of a continuous variable like age.
2. It shows how frequently values fall within specific age ranges (bins).
3. It helps identify patterns such as spread, concentration, and gaps in the data.



* Insights from the graph:

1. Ages are spread across a wide range, roughly from 18 to 70 years.
2. The frequencies across bins appear fairly even, indicating no strong age group dominance.
3. This suggests the dataset includes a diverse age group of users.



* conclusion:The histogram shows a well-distributed age range with no major concentration, indicating a balanced and diverse user population.







**CHART-5 :Subscription plan share**

**-----------------------------------**



* Chart used: Pie Chart



* Why pie chart: A pie chart is used to show proportions or percentage share of categories.It makes it easy to compare how each subscription plan contributes to the total user base. It is best suited when the categories are small



Insights from the chart:

1. The Standard plan has the largest share at around 40%.
2. Basic and Premium plans have almost equal shares, each close to 30%.
3. No single plan overwhelmingly dominates the market.



* Conclusion: The user base is fairly balanced across plans, with the Standard plan being the most popular choice among users.







**CHART-6 :TOP 5 COUNTRIES BY NO OF USERS**

**-----------------------------------------**



* Chart used: Bar graph



* Why bar graph: I have used Bar graph because it is used to represent categorical data(subscription plans),Exact values and relative heights are clearly visible at a glance, which suits summary insights



* Insights from the graph:

1. The USA has the highest number of users among the top five countries.
2. India closely follows, showing strong user adoption.
3. UK, Canada, and Australia have slightly lower but comparable user counts.
4. The differences between countries are relatively small, indicating balanced global usage.



* Conclusion: User distribution across the top five countries is fairly even, with the USA and India leading, showing strong and widespread international presence.
